/*  The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
 */

/*  Design Principle:
 *  Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
 *  Program to an interface, not an implementation.
 *  Favor composition over inheritance.
