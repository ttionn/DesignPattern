/*  The Factory Method Pattern  defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
 */

/*  The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

/*  Design Principle:
 *  Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes.
